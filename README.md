PokePing
========

Find Pokemon using a tracker that works!

:warning: This is an in development POC commandline tool for now. In the future we plan to create a website track Pokemon similar to how the Pokemon GO tracker is surposed to work.

To run, edit index.js with you lat long details (default is Gateway shopping center, Durban, South Africa), then:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

This codebase uses the standard js style, stylecheck with `npm test`.
